Zimmerman: This is Little Richard...  . ..Little Richard's got a lot of expression.  Zimmerman: You gotta have some kind of expression.  Zimmerman: There's no expression.  "I met her at a dance St. Paul  Minnesota... I walk the line, because you're mine, because you're mine..."  Zimmerman: Rhythm and Blues.  Zimmerman:  Ah, Rhythm and Blues you see is something that you really can't quite explain see. When you hear a song Rhythm and Blues - when you hear it's a good Rhythm and Blues song,  chills  go up your spine...  Zimmerman: When you hear a song li ke that. But when you hear a song like Johnny  Cash , whadaya wanna do? You wanna leave, you wanna, you - when you hear a song like some good Rhythm and Blues song you wanna  cry  when you hear one of those songs.  Jen ny Take A Ride Zimmerman: I can't help it.

See Ricky Nelson, Ricky Nelson  -  Zimmerman: Well he copies Elvis Presley! Yeaah, it's perfectly...  Zimmerman: Well he can't sing at all, Ricky Nelson. So we may as well forget him. See I mean - I mean, ya know when you hear music like The  Diamonds . For instance The Diamonds are really cool, they're out on the street really popular, really rec ord [?], you know. So they're popular big stars but where, where do they get all the songs? You know they get all their songs, they get all their songs from little groups. They copy all the little groups. Same thing with Elvis Presley. Elvis Presley, who d id he copy? He copied Clyde McPhatter, he copied Little Richard, ...  Zimmerman: ...he copied the Drifters  Zimmerman: He copied all the Richard songs -  Zimmerman: "Rip It Up", "Long Tall Sally", "Ready Teddy", err ... what's t he other one...   Zimmerman: No, "Money Honey" he copied from Clyde McPhatter. He copied "I Was The One " - he copied that from the Coasters. He copied, ahhh, "I Got A Woman" from Ray Charles.  Oh that guy McKenzie. I like it. I'll do a couple of verses. Sing that whole file if you want me to do it. This is a Woody Guthrie song. Ahh. It’s not that good. It’s a... I gotta do a ... I can’t do a... I can’t do a Talkin’ if we’re on the tape recorder without... It has to be Woody Guthrie. (almost to himself) It has t o be Woody Guthrie.  Talking Columbia Get  Screw YOU Cynthia.

Aw hell, I can't do it Anybody got a capo in the house here ? I don't. Yeah I know but. Oh I. I don't know if I can do impression. This is really something.    One verse is all I learnt.   That was Woody Guthrie's Talkin' Columbia. This is Woody Guthrie's Talkin'  Dustbowl.   No this is Woody Guthrie's Slipknot. Hang about 9 or 6  hanging songs. This is the best one, Slipknot.    Th ank you here's another Woody Guthrie song. Anybody got a C harp ? C harp ?  This is …  a Woody Guthrie song  …  I don't know what it's, Talkin'  Fisherman. You got to read between the lines.  This harmonica holder isn't holding too good, together. Feel like its gonna strangle me here. It's just a hanger, coat hanger. Oh I'll sing a Woody Guthrie song. Anybody got a knife ? Got a knife ? Anyone of you people got a knife ? No ? That sure ain't a big knife. Show you a little trick. Oh. Got a bigger knife. That wasn't the trick. OK. Huh ? Oh good. I really ain't no c omedian. This is a friend of mine Danny Kalb. He plays the guitar, sings, all that. I'm gonna play the harmonica. Stand aside. Thank you. Kind of got lost coming up here tonight. Took a subway. Got off somewhere on 156th Street started walking back. I got hung up in a Cadillac store an …, So I'm not here on time. Almost run over by a bus, so  I took another subway. On to 34th street an I walked up here. Come pretty prepared tonight I got a list on my guitar. This is a new list. I used to have one on my guitar about a month ago, that was no good. Figured I'd get a good list. So I went around an  put the list on first. Then I went around to other guitar players an I sort of looked at their list, copied down songs on mine. Some of these I don't know so good. Well. Let's see here. Here's a (need to leave the stage (off mike)) that's fine. Here I go.  This is story about a little girl running all over, finding out about life. She's going out at night coming home keeping late hours. Finding out just what makes up life, 11 years old. First came here. I used to spend a lot of time with Woody Guthrie. February last February. This is one of Woodys songs. I'll sing a couple more. This is one, one of a group of two. Thanks. Here's a song I guess just about everybo dy knows. Leadbelly used to sing this. Here's a …, here's a. I must admit before I came I learned plenty folk songs in New York. I learned about, … well since I been here now since …, February, last February. I've learned about oh, 4 or 5 new songs I never heard about before. An one I never hea rd about was this one. There's this Irishman. Lian, … Liam Clancy. Sings this one. Err, This is err a straight copy. Straight imitation. I don't imitate the voice much, I can't get that accent quite good enough. This is an Irish one though. Very sad song.  Maybe this the American version of the Irish version of Liam Clancys version. Heard Liam sing this in the Whitehorse Bar, Irish bar Hold the bottle in here. OK wait I gotta fix this, he man you gotta see some pictures of me. I'm not kidding yeah at Whittakers. I look like Marlon Bran.. James Dean or somebody. You gotta see. Like two of this blue turtle neck sweater on. All kinds of pic tures of me, without a guitar. Or else you can just see the top of it. (Dave Glover talks off mike) Ha ha I know what you mean. I sort of made it up on a train. It must be good for somebody this here song I know it's good for somebod y. If it ain't for me, for somebody. i just talked about it. Thank you Oscar and this one's called North Country Girl and it's dedicated to all the north country girls.  Well I guess some people go out in  the streets every day you know. They look into their garage and they see their car. Other people can go out in the street an see their lilac trees. And other people can go out to their porch and water their plants. And err you can also go out in the stree t an see a hobo.  Thanks for inviting me and I also wanna take the opportunity to express my feelings. Thank you for myself and all my friends who where at your house the other night.  This ones called New Orleans Rag, you' ll find out why. I'll try to remember all the verses for you. At one time this was very long. But …. I don't think it will be quite that long tonight. I'll try to see what I can put in it though.  Red wing. Its reform school. Don't have no high school fo otball teams though or nothing like that. No cheer leaders.  This is for all the boys who know girls who want them to go out and get themselves killed. If you …., want to know about the abolishment of boxing I would ask Miss Benny Kid Paret or Mrs. Davey Moore before I asked Cassius Clay. Just a personal tendency there. I believe in the ten commandments. The first one is I am the Lord thy God. It's a great commandment if it's not said by the wrong people. So here's this is called Masters of War.  This is a carnival song, fairgrounds. I just want to speak about it.  I have a poem here. It's not a poem its ahh. This is the first concert I played alone in New York, really. An a fellow in  Brooklyn State Hospital, his name is Woody Guthrie. But err Woody is more than a folk singer. He's real ly something else  more than a folk singer an err there's this book coming out that's dedicated to him. An they asked me to write something about Woody. like what does Woody mean to you in 25 words. An err I couldn't do it I wrote out 5 pages an err I have  it here. I have it here by accident actually. But I'd like to say this out loud. So this is my feelings towards Woody Guthrie. Cannot really be told in err how many records of his I buy, it's a lot more than that actually. So if you can roll along with th is thing here this is called Last Thoughts On Woody Guthrie.  I wanna sing one song here recognising that there are Goliath's nowadays. An err people don't realise just who the Goliath's are but in older days Goliath was slayed and everybody looks back nowadays and sees how Goliath was. Nowadays there are crueler Gol iath's who do crueler crueler things but one day they gonna be slain too, An people 2,000 years from now can look back an say remember when Goliath the second was slain. Here's a song I wrote its about a friend of mine a n it's called Percys Song. An I took the tune from a song that a folk singer by the name of Paul Clayton sings. Called the Wind And The Rain.   Somebody asked me once if this is a love song. And I said, yes it is! It’s a love song!   This is err, this is a song about a boxer, boxer its to do with boxing. This is a song about a boxer. It's not anything to do with a boxer really. It's got nothing to do about nothing. But I threw all these words together, that's all. This is taken out of  the newspapers. Nothing has been changed except the words. Ha. This is called a sacrilegious lullaby in D minor. That's the D minor, ah ha. Right. This is a love song and it's called The Gates Of Eden.  Don't let that  scare you. It's just Halloween. I have my Bob Dylan mask on. I'm masquerading ha ha. There are…. Hey anything you say! Hope I never have to make a living. This is called It's Alright Ma It's Life An Life Only. Yes it's a  very funny song.  This is about the people they say they've never seen you. I'm sure every body has met somebody that swears they've never seen them Hi! I never saw him! Oh God! Here's the second verse of it. Does anybody know the firs t verse of this song. Oh this is the same song, same song only started now. This is a true story right out of the newspapers again. Just the words have been changed around. It's like conversation really. I wanna call….  Oh come on come on. Ok she's coming on now. I wanna bring Joan Baez onstage.  We're gonna do one of Bob Dylan's earlier songs. Go ahead see if I care! More? Can't hear you. God, did I record that? Mary Had A Little Lamb. Is that a protest song? This is called It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding). It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding) ... ho ho ho.  The name of this song is Love Minus Zero, er, slash, over's No Limit. End of quote. Kind of like a painting — the title. Paint it in purple.   This is  called Gates of Eden That was called Gates of Eden!  This is a true story — only the words have been changed. ... nobody's scared! This is called It’s Alright Ma, I’m only Bleeding Ho-Ho-Ho.  What is that thing out there man? What are you trying to say? Does anybody have a C harmonica? Not that one! No!! Just throw it! I think Texas audiences, in Austin and Dallas, are the best.  Excuse me, I just got over a case of leprosy. This is called I don’t believe you. It used to go like that and now it goes like this!  This is called Freeze Out This wouldn't happen to my electric guitar... This is called Freeze Out This is called The 4th Time Around  Er, this song is called, Yes I See You've Got Your Brand New Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat. She wears her brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat sometimes  Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues Ballad Of A Thin Man Er, I'm going to move everybody over there a little bit, so I guess it's wait, you'll have to wait until it gets there.   This is called The 4th Time Around.  Tell me when I get there. This is called Visions of Johanna. OK?   Just a minute! Ha! I'll be there in a minute. Huh? OK. Just ... touch me when we're there, ha.    I'll see ya in fifteen minutes.    This is called-a I Don't Believe You. It used to go like th at and now it goes like this. Hey, Bob! Turn the drummer off! What? Yeah. It's brand new people though. This is, this is called Tom Thumb. This story takes place outside of Mexico City. It begins in Me xico City and it ends really in Des Moines, Iowa, but it’s all about this painter, he’s a quite older fellow, he comes from Juarez, Juarez is down cross of Texas border, some few feets, and he’s a painter. He’s very very well-known painter in the area ther e and we all call him Tom Thumb and when Tom Thumb was going through his blue period, this is one of the most important times of his whole life and he’s going to sell many many paintings now taken from his blue period and this is all about Tom Thumb and hi s early days and so we name this Just Like Tom Thumb’s Blues. Isn’t that right. Hard rain. Hard rain!! Reall!!, One, two.  This one's called-a Yes I See You've Got Your Brand New Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat.   Hard rain? I wish I saw some hard rain last night. Hard rain. Hard rain, I feel no pain, ha. I'll be coming back tomorrow again ... Is that alright with you now?    Thank you very much, y ou're very kind. Thank you, thank you very much. Thanks.

Once I didn't have Jesus within me I didn't know I had an e nemy  . But you can't be victorious unless you do have an enemy. And as this present world we know is coming to a close, you need something strong to hang on to, like a solid rock  . Lots of people don't understand that. Sometimes I think maybe even God's  people are not supposed to understand that, I just don't know  . But we'll pray for them anyway. Because God is calling His people back  . You know the deity of Jesus just drives people crazy sometimes. Some people love him and they wa nt to throw you roses. You can only step in front of the stage and you wouldn't believe it! Some people hate Jesus and they throw toilet rolls at us. Jesus separates all people  . The Bible says if any man should preach you another gospel, other than that,  that can be your curse  . Those are strong words. Thank you, ma'm! After all Jesus can save you too. Jesus is the lamb of God     We have time for one more hymn, we're gonna play this song called In the Garden.

You need a new home? Torn with nostalgia? If you feel it this bad. This is for you.   Thank you. That was Girl From The North Country, I think it was. It sounded like about forty different songs at th e same time, I know. You’re not crazy! Anyway, you know when I grew up there was always a lot of trains going by. Trains in the morning, trains in the afternoon and trains at night. Trains, trains, and more trains. I never got sick of trains. They were alw ays going someplace I wanted to go. San Francisco.

Anyway, this is called  Lets Keep It Between Us. You know what that's all about Thank you. T his is a new song. I don't think we played it here before. I want to say hello to Greil Marcus, if he's here tonight. I think he's here tonight. Greil Marcus is one of the ... , I guess he's the top rock ‘n’ roll critic of the era. Whatever that means.    All right, we're gonna try something new tonight. Don't know how it's gonna come off, but we'll try it anyway. A lot of people ask me, they want to know about old songs, and new songs and stuff like that. This is a song I used  to sing before I even wrote any songs. But this is a real old song, as old as I know. This here is called an autoharp. So this is how I guess you call one of them old folk songs, I used to sing. I used to sing a lot of these things. Well, I hope it brings  you back, I know it brings me back. This is Mary And The Wild Moor. I guess it's about 200 years old.  I have this new song here, it's called Lets Keep It Between Us.  This is a 12-string guitar. First time I heard a 12 string guitar was played by Leadbel ly, don't know if you've heard of him? Anyway, he was a prisoner in, I guess it was Texas State Prison, and I forget what his real name was but people just called him Leadbelly.   He was recorded by a man named  Alan Lomax, I don't know if you've heard of him? Great man, he's done a lot of good for music. Anyway, he got Leadbelly out and brought him up to New York. And he made a lot of records there. At first he was just doing prison songs and stuff like that. Sam e man that recorded him also recorded Muddy Waters before Muddy Waters became a big name. Anyway, Leadbelly did most of those kind of songs. He'd been out of prison for some time when he decided to do children's songs and people said oh, why did Leadbelly  change? Some people liked the old ones, some people liked the new ones. Some people liked both songs. But he didn't change, he was the same man! Anyway, this is a song called ..., It's a new song I wrote a while back. I'm gonna try and do it as good as I c an. there's somebody important here tonight who wants to hear it, so we'll give it our best ....   I don't know if we did that any good. I don't know if we got off or not. I know we can do this one.    Thank you. C arolyn Dennis. Clydie King. Regina McCrary. Tim Drummond on bass. Willie Smith on organ. Jim Keltner on drums. And Fred Tackett on lead guitar.      Thank you! We're gonna slow things down just a little bit. This is Regina McCrary. She's gonna sing a song called Keep On Falling In Love Till I Get It Right.  Let me think, is there anybody out there that's deaf? Now seriously now, is there anybody that's  deaf? Yeah? Pardon me? Excuse me? Fair enough. Well, the reason I ask is we have a deaf persons' specialist here tonight. And, I dunno I guess if there's anybody here that's deaf, she'll aah, she'll interpret it for you. And I'm gonna ask her to come up h ere now. Her name is Jenny Stair, she comes from San Francisco. I don't know which way she's coming from. Oh, here she is, right here. She's a sign language expert. Oh all right, I don't think she can play guitar. Can she play a guitar? I don't know. Jenny , can you play a guitar? Oh yeah? Ok, we're gonna try this one time and see if it works out you know. This is Jenny. OK, now you do your best.   Thank you. Thank you. All right, now we got this song here called I Ain't Gonna Go To Hell For  Anybody. I don't know if we got all the lyrics on it. I wish she was gonna interpret this one. If you to want come back and interpret this.  All right, there is a friend of ours in the house tonight, who's gonna come and play with us.

All right, I was playing a club in Chicago and I guess it was about 1959 or 1960 and I was sitting ...., I was sitting in the restaurant. I think it was  probably across the street or maybe it was in front of the club, I'm not sure. But a guy came down and said that he played the guitar. So he had his guitar with him and he began to play. I said “Well, what can you play? He played all kinds of things, I don ’t know if you’ve ever heard of them. Does Big Bill Broonzy ring a bell?. Or Sonny Boy Williamson and that type of thing. Anyway, he just played circles around anything I could play and I always remembered that. Anyway, we were back in New York, I think it  was 1963 or 1964 and I needed a guitar player on a session there I was doing. And I called up, I did remember his name and he came in and recorded an album, at that time he was working in a Paul Butterfield Blues Band. Anyway, he played with me on the rec ord and I think we played some other dates. I haven't seen him too much since then. Anyway, he played on Like A Rolling Stone and he's here tonight. Give him a hand, Michael Bloomfield! (plays Like A Rolling Stone) Michael Bloomfield! Yeah, go see him if h e’s playing around town!   I wanna say hello to one of my old record producers right here.

Thank you. Here’s a new song here, so ..., if Michael’s still out there, you wanna play on this? Where are you sitting Michael? Anyway, this one’s called Grooms Still Waiting At The  Altar.

Different peoples been coming down to the theater every night so far. And this night is no exception I guess. Anyway this is, keep ..., here's a young man I know you know who he is.  I've played with  him a few times before. I'm a great admirer and fan of his and support his group all the way, Jerry Garcia. He's gonna play with us, in the key of C.    That was Clydie King. This is a new song ..., don't know how old it is. Anyway, it's c alled Can We Keep It Between Us.  A lot of people ask me about old songs and new songs. This is a real old song. This song is so old, I'd say it's about 200 years old. A song I used to sing before I wrote any songs. Anyway, it's one of those tragic, ... tr agic love ballads.    In the evening I was standing out backstage, and this guy came up to me, he said "You remember that woman that came up to you about an hour ago with the long red hair?" And I said, "Yeah I remember that  woman." And he said, "She sure was beautiful, wasn't she?" And I said, "Yes, she was all right." He said "That was me."    We're gonna play a new song here in the key of A. This is called The Groom Is Still Waiting At The Altar.  We sound like the Grateful Dead tonight I actually saw the great Odetta's here tonight.

Thank you all ri ght, this is a song we been trying to get together called I Ain't Gonna Go To Hell For Anybody.  Thank you. When I was at home at eighteen I went to New York City. I was going on nineteen, I guess. Anyway, this young lady I met way back about that long tim e ago. I think I met her about 1960. She used to play the violin on Spring Street. She didn't keep it going all these years. She makes records now I guess. Out here someplace, she used to be in the ..., I don't know if any of you heard of the Jim Kweskin J ug Band? Did you? Well, then they know her. Miss Maria Muldaur. She's gonna sing a song called Nobodies Fault But Mine.  This is another tune I been working on here called Honey Let's Keep It Between Us.  That was a, I guess you call a new song. This one here is old. I used to sing this song before I even wrote any songs. So, it’s about 200 years old, 250.    Thank you. On backup vocals tonight Carolyn Dennis, Clydie King, Reg ina McCrary. Keyboards, Willie Smith. Lead guitar, Fred Tackett. On the bass guitar, Tim Drummond. On the drums, Jim Keltner.      Thank you.

It causes this strange effect on me. I don't know about you, but me it has a certain effect on (....)  Now we're gonna play an older song now. This is now, this is a real old song. Could be written about 500 ye ars ago. I think we used to sing this, we used to sit around years ago and sing this one. Before we even wrote any songs. Before anybody knew how. So this one is called Mary On The Wild Moor.  This is a request. One person wants to hear it.    Thank you. We're gonna slow things down a bit here. This is Clydie King, she's gonna sing a song called You Are So Beautiful.  Thank you! All right. I know I  can't speak for everybody, but I know I speak for myself and everybody in the band and say we really enjoy this time at the Warfield in San Francisco. And I know I speak for everybody when I say I sure hope we do get invited back. Now Bill Graham's got to  have a lot of credit, he's got to get a lot of credit, because when we came here last year, we came in here with a show and the newspapers, they, I don't know, they distorted it, you know, they slandered it, whatever they do about it. However, that's enoug h for most promoters in the business just to cancel out the rest of the shows, but Bill didn't do that. He deserves a lot of credit. Anyway, I ran into a girl here on the street a while back and-a ... she said-a, she said I was a strange person and she tol d me why. She said, she said, "You were born up in a certain area where the ground is metallic". And-a actually she's right. Where I come from the ground is metallic. And-a as a matter of fact during the Second World War, ninety per cent of all the iron an d steel that went into all the ships and the boats and the airplanes and all kinds of weaponry, er, ninety per cent of all the iron steel that went into all that came from the area where I always lived. They dug it out of the ground, so they should've done  something, something to that, I'm sure. But anyway, er ... Yeah, that lake, one of the great lake is called Lake Superior, I don't know if you've ever heard of it. Across the lake is a town called Detroit. And-a I got to happen to go to Detroit once I thi nk when I was about twelve or so, with a friend of mine who had relatives there. Anyway-a, when — I can't remember how it happened but I found — I found myself in a bingo parlor. There were people coming to eat all day and they play bingo all night, and th ere was a dance band in the back. And that was the first time — see where I'm from, I would only hear mostly country music, you know, Hank Williams, Hank Snow, Hank Penny, all kinda Hanks! But anyway so this was my first time face-to-face with rhythm & blu es, it was in Detroit. And when I was about twelve years old, and the man there was singing this song here. I don't think I'll do it as good as he did it, but I'm gonna try to do it anyway.. Thank you. Here's a new song that I started putti ng together this year, called I Ain't Gonna Go To Hell For Anybody.  Thank you. This is Carolyn Dennis she's gonna sing a song called Walking Around Heaven All Day.  Thank you. This is a new song I’m also trying to put together called Honey Let's just Keep  It Between Us, of course it may get out of hand We're gonna try and play an old song now, this is about 1200 years old. Yeah. A sort of old Southern Mountain ballad song that we all used to sing, one time or another. Thank you all right we been here for 12 night I think, and different people have been stopping down. I wanna thank them all. Jerry Garcia was here, lets  see, Elton John, Bruce Springsteen, Captain Beefheart. They all went through here one time or another. Anyway got another special guest, ha ha, tonight. Can't get away we know so many people you know. Anyway I first met this next man I think about, almost  twenty years ago if not that. Probably was, and he was playing in a group, I don't remember the name of the group actually. But he went on and started a group called The Byrds, I'm sure you heard of them. Anyway we've played together before, been on tours  together and all that kind of stuff. I'll bring him out here now, you know who he is, Roger McGuinn. Roger played on this song too. He played on, we recorded it, how many years ago was that Roger? When did we do that? Right. All right, Roger’s playing in the area, you go see him now. Thank you, Clydie King, Regina McCrary and Carolyn Dennis. On the keyboards tonight, Willie Smith. Playing lead guitar tonight, Fred Tackett. On the drums Jim Kelt ner. Playing bass guitar, Tim Drummond. Special guest, Roger McGuinn. All right now, we gotta get out of here. I hope we come back! Let me, er, — I'll let you be... what's that, "I'll let you be in my dreams if I can be in yo urs?"  I love that line . All right. Thank you. Let's slow things down a bit, this is Clydie King who's going to sing a song called   You Are So Beautiful to Me. Thank you, Miss Clydie King! This is a new song I been working on, trying to get it together called, I Ain't Gonna Go To Hell For Anybody. There's a line in it called “the smoke in your eyes is forever”. I started working on this song maybe about six months ago. But I find it interest ing that you read about that hotel that went up in fire, where was it? Las Vegas? I was reading all but a hundred people died. But nobody got burned, they all died from smoke, Hmmm. Anyway, I hope you don't know anybody that was there.  Thank you, Miss Cly die King! This is a new song I’ve working on called Honey Babe Let's Keep It Between Us.  Well, we was all talking about singing old songs, new songs. This is a real old song.

Clydie's been around for awhile. Anyway, this is a thing I been working on for the past six years. One of these d ays I'm gonna have it right. It's called Honey Babe Let's Keep It Between Us. We can work it all out if we just keep it between us.  We're gonna play a real old song now. We're gonna play one that's pretty old, I think about 300 years old. We used to play  this on street corners, it's one of those old Southern Mountain ballads.    All right, that's Clydie King. This is another song I kind of put together. One of these days I will record it I'm sure. Hope to. It's called Honey Baby Let's  Keep It Between Us. We can work it all out, everything will be just fine, if we can manage to keep it only just between us.  This is an old song that I used to sing when I did these kind of songs before I began to write any songs. People always talk about  “sing old songs!”. Well, this is one I used to, to, to write before I wrote songs. I didn't write this one! It’s an old ballad called Mary From The Wild Moor.  Looks like we got a girl who's sitting in the third row now with binoculars on!    I play this song here for someone who came before to come to see me. A young girl I met in Durango Mexico, 1972. She's out there somewhere I know. Are you out there?  OK. Well, then I'll play it. Anyway her name is Victori a, she's a, she's a happy married young lady now, I think.

She's a great singer, she's gonna sing a song called Walking Around He aven All Day.  Thank you. That was Clydie King. This is a new song I been trying to fix, finish up. It's called Honey Baby Let's Just Keep It Between Us. We can work it out everything just fine if we can just manage to keep it between us. I think this is t he song that we played last night they they ..., the critics, newspaper journalists said was Maggie's Farm. But I mean to tell you it's not Maggie's Farm, it's called Let's Keep It Between Us. Yeah, I was walking by Roxy's Heart Memorial Diner. You know wh ere that is? And somebody was telling me about that.  We're gonna play a real old song here that I used to play before I wrote any songs. People always want to hear old songs, well this is real old.

I was raised up North and they keep talking about old times and how old how far past you can get. Well, this is a song I'll play right now. This is pret ty old. I used to play this when I was twelve years old. And ..., this is a song that got me booed off my first stages. When I was ever booed when I  play. The first time was when we played a song like this.

OK, I wanna introduce Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers to you right now. Benmont Tench playing the keyboards. Mike Campbell on the guitar, and ..., one of the finest drummers, I've ever heard in my life, Stan Lynch. Howie Epstein is playing the bass guitar,  and a few other things.

OK now, got to disregard the ending of the last song. We were just practicing that. We have to play San Francisco soon and you know they're fussy  out there about their endings, ha-ha.  OK, here's a song I used to sing when I was twelve years old. And that's old for me. I can't remember when that was but you know people always like to know what kind of songs you sang when you sang them. All right, s o, I have a little better band with me this time ha-ha! Not much though! All right. Good evening. I want to say hello to my good friend. Dennis Hopper. Who's here tonight. I'm sure everybody knows who Dennis is? Dennis is a great actor in t he tradition of Gregory Peck, Montgomery Clift and James Dean. I think I got that right.  OK Tom and  I are gonna sing an old song for you now. Not too old but a few years old. Old as the hills. Anyway this one's about a guy who thinks he knows it all. OK anybody out there know what time it is? Ha-ha Yeah! Ha-h a, all right, now you know. Right. OK now. It gives us a lot of pleasure to play here in the city of the Liberty Bell. And Benjamin Franklin too. Is his house still there? Any of his family still there? Anyway that was called Hell  Time Man. But we won't be doing that song too much longer. There's a magazine called Spin Magazine and they panned that song so, it's got, I know what they say it’s got, don't have too much reality to it, so. You people here will be the last people almost  to hear that song. So if anybody asks you in the future years, to come, did you hear it you can say you heard it here.  All right ah, Ricky Nelson, he did a lot of my songs and I wanna do one of his right now. One called Lonesome Town.  OK Tom Petty and th e Heartbreakers. Here's Benmont Tench on all the keyboards. Mike Campbell on lead guitar. One of the finest drummers in all of America, Stan Lynch. On bass guitar, Howie Epstein. I especially wanna thank Mr. Tom Petty himself. Thank you Tom! All right, bef ore we get too far here now, I have my own Heartbreakers also. I always did and I always will haha. That's Queen Esther Marrow and Carolyn Dennis. Madelyn Quebec and Louise Bethune. OK now it gives me great privilege and grea t honor to sing this song in this particular town. It's about freedom of some sort. And it's about punishment. People who get punished for doing good things instead of bad things. I wanna dedicate this song to all those people who get punished for doing go od things. Yeah. Last time I was here it was '81 or '83, something like that. I don't remember. We played this song. Some people here they were here then.  So they said, "Bob play that song again tonight, we didn't understand it then. We understand it now."    Well, good evening. All right, I guess it's an honor and a privilege to be here in the land of the Boss.   I heard that sound before. Anyway, in the land of the Boss. This is the territory of bosses. Lots of bosses around here right? All kinds of 'em. Anyway, we all love Bruce and say hello and if he is here say we love him.    We have an y people up there wanna come down and sit in front? Come on down. We want four people right here. All right, there we got four people right there. Put them in those four seats right there. There ain't nobody in those seats. Put them in those seats. That's  right. That's what we do every place we play. Sometimes rich people get all the front seats and they don't care what they're seeing. Tom and I are gonna sing an old song for you now. They don't write songs like this no more, ha-ha. I wish they did. I don't  sing until there's some people in them seats right there.    All right, anybody here know what time it is? Ha-ha-ha. What time is it? Don't look at your watches now. That watch won't tell you. It's only got numbe rs on it. All right, we're gonna tell you what time it is.   All right now everybody knows what time it is, we're gonna go on.  Ha-ha- ha, all right, OK. Ricky Nelson, great artist, great rock ‘n’ roll performer. Ricky Nelson did a lot for everybody. He recorded a whole lot of my songs actually. We'll do one of his now, called Lonesome Town.  Thank you, Ricky! All right now, we’re gonna s ing this particular song. I gotta say something. I just got to! Ha-ha, I figure if I didn't have my say, I got to have it now. You know everybody's susceptible to newspapers. Everybody reads them and I know I do. Sometimes we're in a town you know, you pic k up a newspaper the next day, ha-ha, and you read about what you did the night before. That's some trick. So you know now we're playing all these places, I've always had this problem actually. People that come here are rock ‘n’ roll critics. They always c ome. Newspapers always say, well, who's the rock ‘n’ roll critic on the newspaper. You send him down to that show. Now, I don't mind criticism, I think it's a constructive thing. But I object to people who don't pay nothing for a ticket. They can come in h ere and say anything they wanna say. I know a lot of people here have paid for their tickets. And it might be nice sometimes, if their views could be put into the newspaper. Not somebody who comes in on a free ticket. And I'm also now saying that you don't  play everything for a free ticket, cause sometimes we play a lot of shows, when people don't pay nothing to get in. And that's all right too. Actually, sometimes those are the best crowds. But if there's any people here writing about the show for any of y our New Jersey newspapers, ha-ha!. Maybe they wanna check with some of you people, before they write their review. After all you all paid to get in, right?  OK now, a song about St. Augustine, a martyr. A real martyr.   Hurricane? You should say that? Come on now! Hurricane? Are you from the States? Do you know what this State here did to Hurricane? Don't talk to me about Hurricane. We got some people here who don't like him. Marvin Haggler, he's OK though r ight? Yeah, ha-ha, you get it straight first, then I'll get it straight.    Is it past anybody's bed time? Ha-ha, it’s past mine. I should have been in bed hours ago.

OK, we're gonna play this next song. I wanna de dicate this to all the people who have been imprisoned injustly. And I'm not talking about somebody who committed a crime now. I'm talking about somebody who's done good things and gets punished for it. A lot of people lie and they cheat and they steal and  they murder. I’m no big stranger to that stuff. Sometimes people feed the hungry and they visit the sick and they do tell the truth. And for those reasons sometimes people get put into prison. And those are the kind of prisons I'm concerned about. And you  should be to, cause you got a lot of them here in this state.    Hi there. Right now, on this stage, this is a nice place to play, it really is. Anyway, on stage right now, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. Ricky  Nelson he did a lot of my songs, I wanna do one of his and it's called Lonesome Town.  All right it's introduction time.

Adn this is, this has got to be one of the nicest places. So whoever was responsible for this place they should be encouraged to ...., keep on doing this kind of stuff. Well. That's the first time I've ever played that. Well anyway we know where we are.    OK, anybody out there know what time it is? Right? Tom Parker, put it away. I'm gonna tell you what time it is. It's Hell time.    Ricky Nelson he did a lot of my songs. I wanna do one of his. This is called Lonesome Town  Thank you Ricky.  Ok, all right, we’re still just across that borderline. Cause you’re in the middle of the country here. Oh yeah, somebody asked me backstage about the remark I said before about people being in prison for doing good things? Well, I don't know how many peop le are living in prison for doing good things but ..., I was gonna dedicate that to, I'm sure there's some people in there who have been put in there unjustly. So I dedicate it to all of them.    All right now, Tom Petty and the Heartbreaker s are, on the keyboards, Benmont Tench. He loves it, he wants you to know that. Mike Campbell on lead guitar.

Last time I was here, I think I was here about '81, '83. Uptown Theater or wherever it was, I don’t  care, yeah, Uptown Theatre right. Anyway, we played this song last time and nobody had heard it that time, it was the first time. One of the very few times I played it. Since that time it's been recorded so a lot of people have heard it though. I’m gonna  play it again here. Besides there were some people there that night that are also in this crowd tonight and they asked me to please play it again.    OK. One of our ..., one of America's foremost poets is out in the house tonight, I wa nna introduce him, Allen Ginsberg, wherever you are. Two hundred years from now people are gonna be reading Allen Ginsberg. "Howl". Two hundred, maybe three hundred, maybe twenty.    I just wanna say it does not, if, rock music, r ock ‘n’ roll music reviewers here from The Kansas City Star, or The Kansas City Times, whatever. I just wanna ask them would they check with some people on the way out, what they thought, what they saw. Because I think that's only right now, I think that's  only right because these people from the newspapers now, they get in free, you know. So they ..., it’s ..., there’s nothing wrong with getting in free anywhere but a lot of people don't get in free. So we're gonna talk about those people tonight. The peop le who gotta pay a price to get in. I know I’m one. I got to pay a heavy price.    Thank you. That was Masters Of War. I been playing  it that way now for 21 years. Now anyone say it's been changed? It's not been changed. Anyhow right here, right now on stage, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers.    What time is it? What time is it? Feel like saying it's time.

Miss Queen Esther Marrow, Carolyn Dennis and Madelyn Quebec.    OK, I like to dedicate this song to all the people put in prison for doing good things. God knows ther e's a lot of people in prison for doing bad things. Sometimes, somebody gets put away for doing good things. Like ..., visiting the sick and feeding the hungry.  For telling the truth.    All right, thank you. Well, all right. When you  been around the circuit a few times, like I have. Sometimes you know you just get fed up. Anyway, if there is anybody here from Colorado newspapers, reporting on this particular show, please check with some of the people that are here, before you write yo ur, ..... whatever you're gonna write. I say that only for one particular reason. That some times these people you know, they go where they go free. And other people have to pay. So I think they should check with people who have to pay. Regardless of whate ver their opinion is. All right, now we got that out of the way, ha-ha-ha. We're gonna be here tomorrow night. I hope some of you can come back. Ahh, it's an awful nice place to play. It's a little high, but that's all right.    All right now. Was that on the cutting edge ha-ha? What's the cutting edg e?

They decided that we tried to play the harmonica for a while and they stayed home! Anyway, there was an article written in the paper about me saying that the girls should come back and the harmonica should go! Well, nobody showed me that, but they sure told me about it though. Anyway, the girls might be back next time, ... but it’s OK if  I play harmonica on this one, right? Thank you, ladies and gen tlemen! I think it's time to go!

It's a tragic tale of independence and free will How does it  sound? Sound OK? How's the bass? Too loud? Not loud enough? This song was first done on a television show called ...., what was the name of the show? Well, Nancy Sinatra used to like it a lot! Turned up on one of her records (? ?)

Today we’re going to take a musical look at on e of my favorite pastimes. It’s an act of intimacy, the thing that Mae West called a man’s signature. And I’m guessing she knows what she was talking about.  You can call it a lip lock, or, as our friends across the pond call it, “snogging.” I call it good  old-fashioned kissing. You can kiss up, kiss off, kiss the Blarney Stone, or kiss my ass.  So, for the next hour, we’re going to play a little musical game of “spin the bottle.” This is your kissing bandit welcoming you to the osculatory edition of Theme  Time Radio Hour.  Here’s a little lady from Chicago way, though she was actually born in Mississippi. She made her name in Chicago, recording for local labels like Vee-Jay, Cobra, and Wonderful. Wasn’t till she went to Vee-Jay that she made her mark. Here’ s Betty Everett and the Shoop Shoop Song, “It’s in His Kiss.”  If it’s in his kiss, perhaps it’s mononucleosis, commonly known as the “kissing disease.” It’s a viral infection, most often the Epstein-Barr virus. It’s carried in saliva and is usually spread  by kissing. But you can get it from sneezes and coughs also. Personally, I’d prefer to get it from kissing.  Doctor Joyce Brothers reports that before marriage the average American woman has kissed 79 men, which means that 79 men have kissed Doctor Joyce  Brothers.  Blackie Crawford had a band called the Western Cherokees. His singer in that band became much more famous. His name was Lefty Frizzell and he’s a big favorite here around the Abernathy Building. Blackie and Lefty wrote this song together and it  spent 12 weeks at #1 on the country charts. Here’s the always punctual Lefty Frizzell, “Always Late with Your Kisses.”  There’s being late with your kisses and there’s even the worse experience of being left at the altar. That’s what happened to Nicole Con tos. In 1997 she was due to marry a shipping broker by the name of Tasos Michael. She was in a packed church in Manhattan and he left her. He didn’t even show up. But she went on with the wedding by herself. The wedding cost $65,000 and she wasn’t going to  waste it. Her friends rallied around her, enjoyed the $175-a-plate dinner and afterwards cheered her on when she danced to the disco hit, “I Will Survive.” Nicole Contos, a resilient woman.  This is Theme Time Radio Hour. We’re talking about kissing, which means we’re centering on cupidity and not stupidity. Lucinda Williams wrote a song all about passionate kisses. Lucinda’s father was a poet, and a literature professor, and they traveled ext ensively when she was a child through Mexico and Chile as well as the American South.  All that travel was good for her, ‘cause she soaked up a lot of culture. A lot of people know this song because it was a big hit for Mary Chapin Carpenter. A #5 smash. I t got Lucinda her first of three Grammy awards. So, let’s listen to Lucinda’s version from her 1988 album, here’s “Passionate Kisses.”  That was Lucinda Williams, “Passionate Kisses” here on Theme Time Radio Hour, where we’re reminding you that a one-minut e kiss burns about 26 calories. Deep, passionate kissing burns up to 600 calories per hour. If anyone listening needs a workout, I’m available.  Billy Boy Arnold was born in 1935 in Chicago, Illinois. And like Betty Everett, he recorded for the Vee-Jay rec ord label. But he had his start playing harmonica with Bo Diddley. After a couple of records, though, he struck out on his own. You probably know his song, “I Wish You Would.” But this one is all about kissing at a particular time. Here’s Billy Boy Arnold,  “Kissing at Midnight.” [BBC version]  If you’re kissing at midnight, better be careful and not do it where the blue laws are in effect. You can find blue laws in the United States and Canada and they’re meant to protect the Sabbath as a sacred day. These  laws would prohibit breaches in family discipline, public drunkenness, public displays of affection and excesses in dress. They’re called “blue laws” because of the blue paper they were originally printed on.  Let’s move from blue laws to a purple artist,  Minneapolis native, Prince, or as I call him, “The Artist formerly known as the Artist formerly known as Prince.”  Here’s a song of his that was recorded by Tom Jones, The Art of Noise, and a whole bunch of other people. But I’ve always liked the original.  It’s a funk record that doesn’t have any bass on it. Here’s Prince. [BBC version]  That was Prince, and “Kiss.” I always thought KISS should have recorded a song called, “Prince.” I’ll have to call Gene Simmons and ask him about that.   One place a lot of  people kiss is under the mistletoe. Well, it's an interesting legend. According to Scandinavian myth, the Norse god Baldur was the best loved of all the gods. Frigga was his mother, the goddess of love and beauty. She wanted to make sure no harm would eve r come to her beloved son. She went through the entire world getting promises from everything that sprang from the four elements that they would not harm her beloved Baldur.  The evil trickster Loki was able to find the one thing that could harm Baldur, an d that was mistletoe. He made an arrow from the wood of the mistletoe. To be even crueler, he took the arrow to Baldur’s blind brother Hodor. Loki guided Hodor’s hand and shot the arrow at Baldur’s heart. He fell dead, and Frigga's tears changed the red mi stletoe berries to white. But the gods gave mercy on Frigga and Baldur was restored to life. Frigga was so grateful that she showed no hatred for the offending mistletoe plant, making it a symbol of love and promising to bestow a kiss upon anyone who passe d beneath it. [BBC version]  I'm sure some of those kisses happened in the dark.] Here’s Memphis Minnie, one of the great guitarist and singers, “Kissing in the Dark” . [BBC version]  That was Memphis Minnie, “Kissing in the Dark,” written by her husband a t the time, Ernest Lawlars, who was known as “Little Son Joe.”  The average person spends 336 hours of their life kissing. It doesn’t seem like enough.  Another popular “Kiss” was made by Milton Hershey, a candy maker in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. In 1894 he  started the Hershey Company, and they produce chocolates to this day. In 1907 they produced a flat-bottomed, cone-shaped candy. One kind of kiss you definitely want more of is a French Kiss. A lot of people think that the French Kiss originated in France.  Actually, the term became slang in 1923 as a slur to the French. People thought that the French were overly infatuated with sexual matters as anyone who knows the complete version of the poem that begins….“The French, they are a funny race”… can tell you.  [kiss sound] Somehow I wish I didn’t know that.  In France, there’s no such thing as a “French Kiss.” They probably just call it a “kiss,” just like they call French Fries “fries.” In French what it’s called “embrasser avec la langue,” which means literally, “to kiss the tongue.” Or as some prefer to say , “rouler un pelle,” which means, “to roll the blade.”  Here’s a song out of New Orleans, kind of a local hit, but didn’t make a lot of noise anywhere else. I always enjoyed it though, and I thought this would be an opportunity to share it with you. It’s b y a singer named Danny White, this is the closest he ever had to a hit, and it was in 1963. “Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye.”  [BBC version]The closest thing he had to another hit was the next year with a cover version of Earl King’s ballad,  “Loan Me a Handkerchie f,” an admonitory song to say the least.]  Let's continue our kissing show with a guy who didn't have a hit, but he had the last word on a hit. I'll explain it after I play the song. Here’s Huelyn Duvall, “Pucker Paint.” [BBC version]  He never had a hit o f his own, but back in 1958 he was asked to sit in on a recording session. He didn't play guitar on that record, but he added some "oohs" and "aahs" to the A-side, a song called "Train to Nowhere". The B-side was an instrumental, and he didn't play on it a t all. However, he did yell the title out on the end, and sometime every day you can hear Huelyn Duvall yell out "Tequila" at the end of the Champs record.” [BBC version].  Connie Francis was a very popular artist who had a very sad life. [BBC version] But  that’s not how I choose to remember her. Let’s remember Connie Francis in happier times with a light-hearted look at marital infidelity. Here she is: “Lipstick on Your Collar.”  Her father tried to get her to make a living playing and teaching the accordi on. She was on a competition at age 9 on Arthur Godfrey’s “Talent Scouts.” Even then, Arthur Godfrey could tell how beautiful her voice was and convinced her to give up the accordion. She recorded a series of singles that went nowhere. She was on her way t o a pre-med scholarship at New York University. But first, one last recording session, which included a song that she hated, but that her father wanted her to record. She sang it quickly, only doing one take. America fell in love with it, and “Who’s Sorry  Now” was the first of a long string of hits. She knew a lot of different languages, and recorded her songs in Italian,  Hebrew, Spanish, French, German, and Japanese. She starred in the movies in “Where the Boys Are,” “Looking for Love,” and “When the Boys Meet the Girls.”  She retired for awhile, but in 1974 her third husband convinced her to go back on the stage. She had  only done four performances when she checked into a motel on Long Island. The motel lock was faulty, and she was raped. Her marriage fell apart. Shortly thereafter she was bouncing back, but in 1981 her brother was brutally murdered. It was only during the rapy for all these events that she discovered that she was maniac-depressive and had been addicted to pills for maybe as long as 25 years.   She sued the hotel she got raped in for negligence and received 2.5 million dollars, which at the time was the larg est personal injury settlement in history. It doesn't seem enough for the amount of pain she went through. But that’s not how I choose to remember her. Let’s remember Connie Francis in happier times with a light-hearted look at marital infidelity. Here she  is: “Lipstick on Your Collar.”  That was Connie Francis with a story of trouble told in color on the collar of your shirt.   You know how people sign letters with “X”s , that mean little kisses? Well, here’s where that came from. Hundreds of years ago whe n clergy and priests wrote letters they would sign their name, and then they would add a cross. That’s because a cross has many interpretations. One of the primary meanings is “love.” So it was nice to sign off a letter with that. ‘Bout three hundred years  after that, people who were writing love letters started adopting the cross symbol as a shorthand for “love.” But they rotated it ‘bout 45 degrees, so when you take a cross and turn it 45 degrees you get an “X” and they say this rotation was to imitate th e way you turn your head when giving a kiss. So the “X” at the end of a letter became the sign of a kiss.   [Radio Eins version] Now, it seems like I know a lot about kissing.] Here’s Don and Phil with a song written by Don.  It’s from 1959 on the Cadence  record label, and if you have to ask, “Don and Phil who?” you’re not a regular listener of this show. Here are the Everly Brothers, “Til I Kissed You.”  The tradition of lifting the veil and kissing the bride is a combination of two old customs. Lifting th e veil was a part of the ancient wedding ritual. See, marriages used to be arranged by family members. The newlyweds quite often had never met. These arranged marriages had large sums of money riding on them, and sometimes there was the fear that if the gr oom didn't like the bride’s looks he might refuse to marry her and her family would lose a great dowry. This is why the father of the bride gave the  Jesus Gonna Be Here San Diego Serenade All right, thank you, friends, I  want to introduce my band right now.
